## Scala | Pattern matching

**Match.** In languages like Scala 3.3 we often need to handle special cases based on the values in our data. Pattern
matching is a solutionâ€”and Scala supports pattern matching.

**With the match keyword**, we begin a match construct. We use cases to indicate values to be matched. We can return
values
directly from cases.

**A review**. Pattern matching is similar to a "switch" statement in C-like languages. But in Scala we can use more
advanced patterns. This simplifies code and makes it clearer.
